# Welcome to My Open The Iris
***

## Task
The task is to train and evaluate several models from scratch based on the Iris dataset 

## Description
To do so, we have gone through the following steps: 
- we have loaded our Iris dataset 
- we have summarized key statistical features of this datasets
- we have plotted our dataset
- we have trained the following models based off of the dataset: 
    - DecisionTree
    - GaussianNB
    - KNeighbors
    - LogisticRegression
- we have evaluated our data set using cross validation 

## Installation
You can run the project in the Jupyter Notebook environment. 

## Usage
The program will load the csv data and represent it in a Pandas dataframe. Then, it will provide the key statistical 
summary of the dataset. After that, it will illustrate the relationship between variables of the data using both 
univariate and multivariate plots. Finally, the program will partition the dataset into training and testing sets, train 
several models on a training set, and display the performance of each.
